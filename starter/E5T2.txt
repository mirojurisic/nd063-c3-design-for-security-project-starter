# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:
1) Checkov -terraform IaC analysis tools
2) ECR - image scanning
3) Wiz - cloud account configuration settings scanner
4) Sonarsource - static code analysis tools
## Scan infrastructure as code templates
1) Checkov -terraform IaC analysis tools

### Example vulnerability
- Report if there is a overly permissive security group rule but also recommendation that are not security issue like 
when S3 bucket do not have versioning it will give a message "Ensure all data stored in the S3 bucket have versioning enabled"
	
##Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities
Amazon ECR image scanning 
### Example vulnerability
some outdate libraries
- gives description
    "description": "In libssh2 v1.9.0 and earlier versions, the SSH_MSG_DISCONNECT logic in packet.c has an integer overflow in a bounds check, enabling an attacker to specify an arbitrary (out-of-bounds) offset for a subsequent memory read. A crafted SSH server may be able to disclose sensitive information or cause a denial of service condition on the client system when a user connects to the server.",
- gives recommendations
    text": "Update all packages in the vulnerable packages section to their latest versions."

##Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities
https://www.wiz.io/
### Example vulnerability
It can scan IAM policies and report which one are excessive or unused permissions which should be modified or removed.
